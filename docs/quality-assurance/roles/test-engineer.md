|  Areas | Tasks | Stories |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| ​Deliver, under tuition, test automation as part of the Agile Scrum Team (35%) | ​Writing test automation code | ​A PBI requires automated tests; it is building on existing functionality so the automation tester can use existing automation code and add in the extra tests. |  
| Create relevant test documents for project (Test Approach, Test Strategy, Test Summary Report) (5%)) | Responsible for the creation of the Test Strategy, Test Approach and the Test Summary report as required | At the start of a project the tester takes ownership of producing the relevant document that provides details on how testing of the product will be undertaken. This must be produced in conjunction with the developers and Delivery Manager, and they will ensure the document is signed off.If required, the tester will create a Test Summary Report that provides an overview of the testing completed. |  
| ​ |  Assist with the management of defects through to resolution, by processing them in the test tools, communicating effectively on the issue and carrying out re-tests as required (5%). | Raise good quality defects | The tester discovers a defect in a product. They raise a defect and include details on the impact, how the defect can be re-created and its importance. |  
| ​ | ​Ensures that all defects raised within a sprint are followed up | ​There are several open defects, the tester can see that if one of them is fixed it will allow a PBI to be completed. They discuss with the developers and they agree to focus on that defect first. |  
| Analysing Requirements and designing manual or automated tests (25%) | Review requirements to understand how they can be tested | The role helps review requirements; the tester sees that altering the requirement slightly would help the testing of it so they discuss this with the Delivery Manager and lead developer. |  
| ​ | ​Design manual tests | ​A feature needs to be manually tested so the tester uses test design techniques to create both happy and unhappy path test plans. |  
| ​ | ​Design Automated tests | ​A feature will need automated tests; the tester uses test design techniques to create the relevant automated tests, using TDD and BDD approaches. |  
| ​Carry out Testing (25%) | Leads the use of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) within the scrum team | The Delivery Manager is finding it challenging to add acceptance criteria to a PBI. They work with the Delivery Manager using BDD techniques to create acceptance criteria. |  
| ​ | Carries out exploratory testing  | A feature is under test; the tester feels that some exploratory testing will help look for defects.  They use a test charter and test persona to carry out some exploratory testing. |  
| ​ | ​Runs any manual testing  | ​The tester reviews open PBIs and decides that some of the tests are better suited to be run manually. |  
| ​ | ​Ensure that any automated testing is being used and any failures followed up | ​The tester notices that some of the automated tests have failed; they investigate and seeks support/advice form other members of the team if needed. |  
| ​ | Has some responsibility for ensuring that testing on a project adds up to a coherent whole | A project uses several different testing techniques - automated, manual, non-functional. The tester sees that there is a lack of security testing, so they recommend to the Delivery Manager that several security testing PBI&#39;s are added to the backlog. |  
| ​ | ​​Looks at the testability of a product | As part of backlog refinement they see that asking the developers to create a stub will allow the team to be able to progress testing rather than having to wait for another PBI to be completed. |  
| ​Continually develop own skills as part of a program of professional development (5%) | ​Creates and takes pro-active ownership of a continuous learning cycle for themselves | ​Reviewing their current skill level, they identify that they have a knowledge gap on how DevOps works. They put together a plan that utilises books, and online materials to gain a better understanding. |
