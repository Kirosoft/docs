# Technical Debt Monitoring

The UKHO utilises it's [Grafana instance](https://grafana.mgmt.local/?orgId=1) to provide a series of dashboards for technical debt monitroing. The solution focuses on the Ukhydro Azure DevOps instance and utilises the [azdo-techdebt-exporter](https://github.com/UKHO/azdo-techdebt-exporter) prometheus exporter to produce the data set and metrics.

## Dashboard Breakdown

The dashboards can be found by selecting the "Search Dashboards" option (top left) and then opening the "Technical Debt" folder. Current dashboards are located here and all future dashboards created related to technical debt should be placed within this folder.

## Support and Improvements
